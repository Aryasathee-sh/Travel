    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Public health services in Brazil are free for foreign tourists. Therefore, if you are in an accident, need medical attention, or have any health issues, just call the Mobile Emergency Medical Service (SAMU) on the toll-free number below.</p>
    <h3>SAMU (Mobile Emergency Medical Service): 192</h3>
    <h2>Health Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Drink lots of water. Brazil is a tropical country, so we recommend that you keep hydrated at all times.</li><br>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Wear comfortable clothes. Protect your skin from the sun by wearing a hat, a cap, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Avoid staying in the sun between 10 am and 4 pm.</li><br>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Brazil continues to follow all security protocols to combat COVID-19. In order to reduce the risk of contamination, wear protective masks and wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Also, use hand sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol, especially after using public transport or visiting tourist attractions where there are crowds.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vaccines</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In order to enter Brazil, it is not mandatory to be vaccinated against any specific type of disease. However, there are some regions in the country where there is a Recommendation for Vaccination (ACRV) before the visit. For example, in the regions where cases of yellow fever have been documented.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px;">Brazil has increasingly invested in public safety. The country has been strengthening security in tourist destinations so tourists who intend to visit the country can feel safe when traveling to Brazil.</p>
     <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Ministry of Tourism is creating the Safe Tourism Program, a national program that focuses on several fields of action to increase tourist safety. This way, visitors will be able to enjoy all the wonderful attractions Brazil has to offer.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">If there are any incidents, there are police stations all over the Brazilian territory. Most capital cities have specialized police stations to assist tourists. If you happen to be in a city where there is no specialized police station for tourists, you can contact any regular police station to file your incident report. This means more safety and attention for tourists who come to Brazil.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">Visas are required for foreigners to enter and stay in the Brazilian territory for any period of time. They are granted by the Brazilian Consular Offices abroad.

        Citizens of Mercosur member states do not need a visa to enter and stay in Brazil, the need only a valid passport or national identity document. Visitor visas may be granted for different purposes, such as tourism, business, transit, and artistic or sports activities. Visitors on this type of visa are allowed to stay for a maximum of ninety days.</p>
       
        <h3>Do you need a visa?</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">To find out if you need a visa to travel to Brazil.

            Brazil’s visa policy is based on the principle of reciprocity. This basically means that most countries that require visas from Brazilian citizens to enter their territories will also need a visa to travel to Brazil. Under current Brazilian immigration law (Law 13,445 of 2017), visa exemption may only be granted by the Brazilian authorities on a reciprocal basis, and through mutual understanding on the matter. Brazil currently has bilateral agreements on visa waivers with approximately 90 countries.</p>

        <h3>Where to apply for a visa:</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Itamaraty, the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brazil, is the government agency responsible for granting visas. This occurs through its Embassies, Consulates General, Consulates, and Vice-Consulates abroad.

            Foreigners who wish to apply for a visa to travel to Brazil should contact Brazilian Consular Representations abroad in order to obtain more information on the application process.</p>

              </div>
              <p style="font-size: 20px;">Power voltage in Brazil varies between 110V and 220V, depending on the location you’re in. Many Brazilian hotels offer electric outlets in both voltages, and you can easily find portable voltage transformers in electrical supply stores.

                Power outlets in Brazil are type N and have the standard 3-pin sockets. For safety, the outlets are recessed. This way, plugs have to be fully inserted into the outlet for power to pass through, thus preventing accidental contact with live plugs.
                
                Power outlet adapters can be easily found at electrical supply stores or at airport convenience stores.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">Brazil has tropical weather. The average annual temperature is 28°C in the North region and 20°C in the South of the country. Brazilian winter is between June and September, and in some cities in the South and Southeast of the country, temperatures drop below 0°C, with frost and snow. In the summer, it is possible to enjoy the 40°C heat in cities like Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, for example. Summer in Brazil is the best time to go to the beach, drink coconut water, swim in the sea, and sunbathe.

        When packing for your trip, please choose light and comfortable clothes. Items such as hats, caps, sunglasses, and sunscreen are useful to protect your skin from the sun. In forest areas, such as the Amazon and the Pantanal, we recommend the use of closed-toe shoes, long-sleeved t-shirts and shirts (preferably in light colors), long pants, and a hat to keep insects away.</p>
